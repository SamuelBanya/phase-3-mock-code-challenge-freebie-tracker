These are the commands I used to create the related migration accordingly:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash   
bundle exec rake db:create_migration NAME=create_freebies
#+END_SRC

I then ran the migration with this command:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
bundle exec rake db:migrate
#+END_SRC

I then used this command to seed the data accordingly:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
bundle exec rake db:seed
#+END_SRC
